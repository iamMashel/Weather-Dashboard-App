🛠️ Project: "Weather Dashboard App"
🌤 Features:
Search for a city and view real-time weather data

Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

Show a 5-day forecast

Save last searched cities (localStorage)

Optionally add dark mode toggle

Progressive enhancements:

Add location autocomplete

Add geolocation (detect your city)

Use charts for temperature trend (Chart.js)

🔧 Tech Stack:
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) – for core logic

HTML5 + CSS3 (or Tailwind if you prefer)

Fetching from OpenWeatherMap API

localStorage for saved searches

Optional: Add Webpack & modular JS

🚀 Next Steps: Weather App Enhancement Roadmap
Let’s gradually level up this simple project. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

✅ 1. 5-Day Forecast Feature
Goal: After showing current weather, display a forecast for the next 5 days.

📦 API Endpoint:
Use OpenWeatherMap's 5-day/3-hour forecast endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}&units=metric
🎯 Focus on:

Parsing daily temps (pick 12:00 PM readings from each day)

Displaying cards for each day's weather

✅ 2. Save Search History (localStorage)
Goal: Store searched cities locally so users can revisit them.

🧠 Store recent cities in localStorage

🖱️ Add click buttons to re-search from history

💡 Optional: Limit to 5 recent searches

✅ 3. Dark Mode Toggle
Goal: Add a switch to enable dark mode.

Use a checkbox or toggle

Add dark-mode class to <body>

Save preference in localStorage

✅ 4. Responsive Design
Goal: Make sure your app looks great on all devices.

📱 Use media queries or CSS Grid/Flexbox

Ensure input and forecast cards scale on mobile

✅ 5. Code Refactoring (Modular JS)
Goal: Clean up script.js by splitting logic.

Example file structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
weather-dashboard/
├── js/
│   ├── api.js      # API fetching logic
│   ├── ui.js       # DOM rendering
│   └── storage.js  # localStorage management
Use <script type="module"> to import functions.

✅ 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages
If not already done:

Go to Repo → Settings → Pages

Under Source, select main and / (root)

It gives you a public URL like:
https://yourusername.github.io/weather-dashboard/

✅ 7. Add Polish
Add loading spinners or animations

Handle errors more gracefully (city not found, rate limit, etc.)

Add icons for each weather type using OpenWeatherMap’s icon URLs

Add Chart.js to graph 5-day temperature trend

📦 Optional: Move to React or Vite Later
Once you’ve finished this version, we can rebuild it using:

React (components, state hooks)

Vite or Parcel for modular code and .env support

Tailwind CSS for UI polish

✅ Let’s Start With: 5-Day Forecast
